      Hi, my name is Rasmus Svanberg.
      <br>
      I am a software developer currently employed by ROL Ergo AB in Jönköping, Sweden, where I have worked since June 2021.
      Here, I have been a fullstack developer, though mainly focusing on front-end.
      <br><br>
      I studied computer science at the School of Engineering at Jönköping University, where I graduated in June 2021.
      Currently I am located in Nässjö, Sweden, where I live with my girlfriend Kajsa, and our dog Zuko, who is a mittelspitz.
